                "transcript": "[Music] Formula Student is a special event. Uh we are a competition for students all over the world uh who will be learning for the future. [Applause] Um the impact for our students uh from our competition here in Germany on the Hognim ring on the formula student Germany is that we want to u bring a practical u um experience to the students uh beside the lectures in university only with our partners like Magna for example we are able to um bring this competition to life. Yeah, we have to uh bring all uh volunteers here and uh organize the competition and that's only possible with our partners. This year is a very special moment for us because we are celebrating our 20th anniversary. So since 20 years we're trying to build the future for engineers here in Hogn. Uh basically just the interest in the project and the people and the cars. I always loved racing since I was a small child and this was the perfect opportunity for me to get into racing and on top of that I had a chance with a great team that yeah shares this passion for racing to work on such a great race car you can see here. Um so it's more fulfilling a childhood dream than anything else. Actually my love for the cars and car culture and also the project was fun because I participated and was hobbyist in electronics field. So the EV formula student team was perfect for me because I could join my two passions at once. I am this year head of marketing and the past couple of years I just was a normal marketing member. I was the team leader of rent unis stoodka this year and therefore more or less I'm responsible that nobody gets killed but on top of that I have to uh yeah structure the whole team and uh yeah put people there where they can yeah put in their skills the best they can. My role in the project after the previous question is obviously that I am in the LV and HV electronics team and I mostly do the uh insulation monitoring device stuff uh work sometimes with the inverters also we had some driverless project going few years back and then I was designing the EBS system. I would say the events in general when the team goes through highs and lows and you celebrate it together, but you also uh you're disappointed together, but at the end you're a team. So, I guess that that really that's it for the team. Oh, I think I have to say that was in January. uh you have to know you have to qualify for those races and um yeah in the first qual or in the first quiz we had to take we didn't compete or didn't yeah put in our best uh yeah day I would say but then suddenly luck kicked in and we had a second strike and then we really did the best job we could do and that was when we yeah formed the team. Uh yeah the in my opinion and observations the moment that our team came together was the first proper international competition that was 3 years ago uh in the Spain and we have there was everything new for us because we are not so old team and we had to work really together to make it work and somehow it work we didn't have much of the success late then back then, but we really like had the tight bond with each other from this time and we have so many great memories when we did some weird things. But yeah, I would say I know that um I probably want to go into marketing for uh some of the sponsors that we have or for one of the sponsors that we have. You get to know the firms. You get to know what they work with and how they work like and if they if they communicate with you, things like that. Oh, it shaped me in many different ways. I think what I learned for myself is that I not only want to become an engineer, but I want to become some kind of team leader, team manager to do something in that in the future working with people and take on responsibility. I think that's what I enjoyed the most the last two years and I'm really happy the for the opportunity FSG granted me. But also yeah this club granted me and yeah I got more thankful for the things I have. I think that's something very beautiful for me a student. Yeah it actually shaped my present because uh at I have the halftime job that is uh somehow managed by uh participating in for student competition. So yeah uh the initiative is great for the HR and the recruiters also because when they see you did something practical and for real example by your studies you are more likely to get hired. So also I think personally that formula student with the knowledge base gave me more than my studies themselves.",
