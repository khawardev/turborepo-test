Sharath Reddy breaks down how systems thinking is shaping the next era of mobility in this week's #MagnaTechTalk . #MobilityInnovation #SystemsThinking #AutomotiveTech #EVs #ADAS #SoftwareDefinedVehicles #TechTalk",

                    "I Believe ADAS and sensor fusion are most ready for a system level transformation because seamless integration of cameras l, radar, lidar and Ai software will not only improve the safety and performance but I believe set foundations for more scalable software driven platforms",
                    "Great perspective on why collaboration and systems thinking are key to driving the next wave of mobility innovation.",
                    "The path to Platforms is a rocky, very very long one that requires many prerequisites, discipline and perseverance. In my opinion, Systems Thinking helps a lot, even with smaller or merely complicated (aka non-complex) systems. Especially when the human factor comes into play.",
                    "The race has to be to develop the best system, not the first system. Early releases of sub par technology disappoints the user and they may never turn back to that technology even once perfected.",
                    "Good insight, Sharath Reddy . Strongly agree with your points. However, there are some interesting implications. What are the right core competencies for OEMs and suppliers today? Feels like systems engineering and thinking are rising in importance, integrating hardware and software across domains. But that is a dramatic departure from what has traditionally been the core competency of OEMs, which has been ICE and chassis. Curious to hear your thoughts, especially as many are looking to reinvent themselves in the context of battery, E/E systems, and semiconductors.",
                    "More than tens years ago, Bosch was selling ADAS solution to OEMs, USS, Radar, camera, Lidar. Due to high cost, high integration and dependance on supplier for the technology, OEMs decided to move to component solutions for next platform. OEMs would like to control the system with high integration, and central management the knowhow of ADAS system. Then problems raised due to lack of system competence, lack of definition of interfaces between each components, and functions. Then they seperate ADAS again by HW, SW. No matter system solution, or component solution, it's all about how to ensure integration seamless of HW and SW with 100% definition of interfaces of each part and each function. And how to ensure the SW is talking to each other simultaneously w/o defects. Camera is like the eyes to vehicle, ECU is the brain to vehicle. All solutions for ways to L2++, L3/L4 have pros and cons. Who domains the speed to market, technology and algorism, who wins in coming five years of high EV, high autonomous driving world. Sharath Reddy , you will achieve the dominant leading ADAS!",
                    "Systems Thinking is about ID-ing the ACTUAL ROOT CAUSES of issues, and then eliminating those. eCars are much better, but do NOT eliminate the entire issue. . THE root cause of all transport issues are, that they are placed on destroyed land in a 2d format. Even all mass-passenger Air Transport has this issue, since it is incapable of 1st-Last km pickup+delivery, so a road/track system must also be used. ... Getting rid of Ground-Based-Vehicles, over to STT (Suspended Track Transport) systems, & reverting most all roads, tracks, etc. back to the Nature they destroyed, is what will help save the planet — — our MOST PRESSING ISSUE. STT systems eliminate all the issues involved with Self-Driving, since THEIR self-driving, is implicitly safe, by being driverless and track-guided. Being elevated also happens to eliminate nearly ALL the bad issues caused by Ground-Based-Transport, especially annual maintenance, as the 126 year old STT Wuppertal SkyTrain system proves."
